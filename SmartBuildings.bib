abstract = {Many Smart Building systems, such as indoor localization or occupancy monitoring systems, require the installation of several transmitting and receiving nodes. The quantity and the positioning of these devices heavily affects the accuracy and the total cost of the system, but tools to automate the nodes configuration currently lack. We propose an open-source design tool for the specification of the building floor plan. The tool is able to suggest a near optimal allocation of sensor nodes, depending on hardware characteristics and prices, in order to maximize the coverage area while minimizing the total cost.},

@article{Gwon2004,
abstract = { We present algorithms for estimating the location of stationary and mobile users based on heterogeneous indoor RF technologies. We propose two location algorithms, selective fusion location estimation (SELFLOC) and region of confidence (RoC), which can be used in conjunction with classical location algorithms such as triangulation, or with third-party commercial location estimation systems. The SELFLOC algorithm infers the user location by selectively fusing location information from multiple wireless technologies and/or multiple classical location algorithms in a theoretically optimal manner. The RoC algorithm attempts to overcome the problem of aliasing in the signal domain, where different physical locations have similar RF characteristics, which is particularly acute when users are mobile. We have empirically validated the proposed algorithms using wireless LAN and Bluetooth technology. Our experimental results show that applying SELFLOC for stationary users when using multiple wireless technologies and multiple classical location algorithms can improve location accuracy significantly, with mean distance errors as low as 1.6 m. For mobile users we find that using RoC can allow us to obtain mean errors as low as 3.7 m. Both algorithms can be used in conjunction with a commercial location estimation system and improve its accuracy further.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce the Multimode Covering Location Problem. This is a generalization of the Maximal Covering Location Problem that consists in locating a given number of facilities of different types with a limitation on the number of facilities sharing the same site. The problem is challenging and intrinsically much harder than its basic version. Nevertheless, it admits a constant factor approximation guarantee, which can be achieved combining two greedy algorithms. To improve the greedy solutions, we have developed a Variable Neighborhood Search approach, based on an exponential-size neighborhood. This algorithm computes good quality solutions in short computational time. The viability of the approach here proposed is also corroborated by a comparison with a Heuristic Concentration algorithm, which is presently the most effective approach to solve large instances of the Maximal Covering Location Problem.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {We propose a graph-based, low-complexity sensor fusion approach for ubiquitous pedestrian indoor positioning using mobile devices. We employ our fusion technique to combine relative motion information based on step detection with WiFi signal strength measurements. The method is based on the well-known particle filter methodology. In contrast to previous work, we provide a probabilistic model for location estimation that is formulated directly on a fully discretized, graph-based representation of the indoor environment. We generate this graph by adaptive quantization of the indoor space, removing irrelevant degrees of freedom from the estimation problem. We evaluate the proposed method in two realistic indoor environments using real data collected from smartphones. In total, our dataset spans about 20 kilometers in distance walked and includes 13 users and four different mobile device types. Our results demonstrate that the filter requires an order of magnitude less particles than state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining an accuracy of a few meters. The proposed low-complexity solution not only enables indoor positioning on less powerful mobile devices, but also saves much-needed resources for location-based end-user applications which run on top of a localization service.},

abstract = {The goal of the paper is to provide an overview of the following classes of models:. Gradual cover models: These models seek to relax the "all or nothing" assumption by replacing it with a general coverage function which represents the proportion of demand covered at a certain distance from the facility. The cooperative cover model: This recently developed generalization is designed to replace the "individual coverage" assumption with a mechanism where all facilities contribute to the coverage of each demand point. This is accomplished by viewing coverage as the transmission of a "signal" by the facilities. The signal transmitted by each facility dissipates with distance. However, the signal received by each demand point is the aggregation of the transmissions from all the facilities. If the signal strength at the demand point exceeds a certain threshold, the point is covered, otherwise it is not. Variable radius model: This model is primarily designed to relax the "fixed coverage radius" assumption, making the coverage radius an endogenously determined function of the facility cost. Thus, instead of having to locate a certain pre-determined number of facilities, the decision-maker has a certain budget that can be used to construct facilities of different types, with the more expensive facilities having larger coverage radius. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This problem is motivated by monitoring applications in sensor networks, as well as robustness concerns and protocol requirements.

abstract = {Wireless indoor positioning systems have become very popular and attractive in recent years. These systems have been successfully used in many fields such as asset tracking and inventory management, and location fingerprinting schemes are the most promising technique because of technical restrictions. However, how to optimize the location of access points to improve the positioning accuracy is still a challenging and difficult problem because of the complexity of indoor radio propagation environments. In this paper, we firstly discussed the indoor radio propagation model and proposed a novel optimization model for access points location optimization in which the Euclidean distance of received signal strength array among all the sampling points should be maximize in order to increase the differentia and diversity of the signal strength array, and thus improve the positioning accuracy of location fingerprinting schemes. Then we presented the Differential Evolution algorithm which was used to optimize the proposed problem, and the experimental testbed, experimental results and analysis were discussed. Experimental results show that the proposed model for access points location optimization can improve the positioning accuracy remarkably. Finally, we summarized the paper and gave possible future directions for research on access points location optimization for indoor environments. Keywords-},

abstract = {The primary focus of Green IT has been on reducing energy use of the IT infrastructure itself. Additional significant energy savings can be achieved by using the IT infrastructure to enable energy savings in both the IT and non-IT infrastructure. Our premise is that energy can be saved by driving building operation on information gleaned from existing IT infrastructure already installed for non-energy purposes. We call our idea implicit occupancy sensing where existing IT infrastructure can be used to replace and/or supplement traditional dedicated sensors to determine building occupancy. Our implicit sensing methods are largely based on monitoring MAC and IP addresses in routers and wireless access points, and then correlating these addresses to the occupancy of a building, zone, and/or room. Occupancy data can be used to control lighting, HVAC, and other building functions to improve building functionality and reduce energy use. We experimentally evaluate the feasibility of this dual-use of IT infrastructure and assess the accuracy of implicit sensing. Our findings, based on data collected from two facilities, show that there is significant promise in implicit sensing using the existing IT infrastructure present in most modern non-residential buildings. 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Two problems are considered in this article. Both problems seek the location of p facilities. The first problem is the p median where the total distance traveled by customers is minimized. The second problem focuses on equalizing demand across facilities by minimizing the variance of total demand attracted to each facility. These models are unique in that the gravity rule is used for the allocation of demand among facilities rather than assuming that each customer selects the closest facility. In addition, we also consider a multiobjective approach, which combines the two objectives. We propose heuristic solution procedures for the problem in the plane.

For the professional siting facilities, the task of translating organizational goals and objectives into concrete facilities requires a working familiarity with the theoretical and practical fundamentals of facility location planning and modeling. The first hands-on guide to using and developing facility location models, Network and Discrete Location offers a practiceoriented introduction to model-building methods and solution algorithms, complete with software to solve classical problems of realistic size and end-of-chapter exercises to enhance the reader's understanding. The text introduces the reader to the key classical location problems (covering, center, median, and fixed charge) which form the nucleus of facility location modeling. It also discusses real-life extensions of the basic models used in locating: production and distribution facilities, interacting services and facilities, and undesirable facilities. The book outlines a host of methodological tools for solving location models and provides insights into when each approach is useful and what information it provides. Designed to give readers a working familiarity with the basic facility location model types as well as an intuitive knowledge of the uses and limits of modeling techniques, Network and Discrete Location brings students and professionals alike swiftly from basic theory to technical fluency.},

Enabled by such occupancy monitoring capabilities, there are extensive opportunities for improving the energy consumption of buildings via smart HVAC control. In this respect, the major challenges we envision are 1) to achieve occupancy monitoring in a minimally intrusive way, e.g., using the existing infrastructure in the buildings and not requiring installation of any apps in the users??? smart devices, and 2) to develop effective data fusion techniques for improving occupancy monitoring accuracy using a multitude of sources. This paper surveys the existing works on occupancy monitoring and multi-modal data fusion techniques for smart commercial buildings. The goal is to lay down a framework for future research to exploit the spatio-temporal data obtained from one or more of various IoT devices such as temperature sensors, surveillance cameras, and RFID tags that may be already in use in the buildings. A comparative analysis of existing approaches and future predictions for research challenges are also provided.},

The key technolog-ical driver for these gains are the novel sensor network de-ployments and the large amounts of data that they generate. The challenge however is making sense of this data, and us-ing it effectively to design smarter building control schemes. Several recent research efforts have sought to address the challenge of data access and building control. However, while these systems have made progress in specific areas, many unanswered questions still revolve around data man-agement and what exactly it means to develop building ap-plications. Critically, how would such a solution work in a real building setting and how can applications be written such that they can be re-used in other settings?

Leveraging Wi-Fi fingerprints and user motion information, this system automatically constructs floorplan via three key steps: (1) room adja- cency graph construction to determine which rooms are adjacent; (2) hallway layout learning to estimate room sizes and order rooms along each hallway, and (3) force directed dilation to adjust room sizes and optimize the overall floorplan accuracy. Deployment study in three buildings with 189 rooms demonstrates high floorplan accuracy.

abstract = {Nowadays many systems with diverse technologies such as (GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Ultra Wide Band, Ultrasounds, Infrared, etc) can be used for indoor location. One of the biggest challenges in indoor location systems is to determine the actual indoor position of the user using a smart device (Phone, PC, etc), due to their instability, cost, high-power consumption, low accuracy and low precision. To overcome those problems, we have designed, implemented and emulated an indoor location system based on RSSI (Receive Signal Strength indicator) of the Bluetooth low energy 4.0 (BLE). BLE 4.0 technology is more advantageous in terms of long life expectancy, our approach is based on the deployment of equidistant nodes on the ceiling. The nodes are programmed to broadcast a periodic beacon at a time pace of 400ms and then to enter sleep mode. When a smart device enters within the broadcasting range, it locates the three access points (nodes) with the highest signal strength. This information can be calculated using one of the several localization algorithms (Dilatation). The proposed Dilatation algorithm can be easily implemented in the hardware due to its low complexity, the method can be successful even when using a few numbers of nodes. In average the system has about 0.5 {\~{}} 1 meters of error.},

Nevertheless, it admits a constant factor approximation guarantee, which can be achieved combining two greedy algorithms. To improve the greedy solutions, we have developed a Variable Neighborhood Search approach, based on an exponential-size neighborhood.

abstract = {The main purpose of buildings is to provide a comfortable living environment for their occupants. This includes, among others, thermal, visual and acoustic comfort as well as indoor air quality. Except during the 1950's and 1960's, it has always been considered important that an excess use of energy should be avoided in the construction and the management of a building, sometimes even at the cost of user comfort. Energy saving is, however, not the main purpose of the building. Indeed, if it were really so, the largest energy savings would be obtained by not erecting the building in the first place. Since the Rio conference, there have been more and more incentives to save energy and lower the impact of buildings on the environment. Therefore, there is no excuse for the building sector not to adopt a sustainable development policy. Some energy is required to control the indoor climate and indoor air quality. Therefore, it is often suspected that energy savings result in poorer indoor environment quality, or, on the contrary, that a high comfort level is the result of high technology and high energy consumption. This is not true. It is now generally admitted among building scientists that high quality energy services do not necessarily incur a high energy use, and that good environment quality can be obtained with a reasonable amount of energy and power, and with a low environmental impact. The presentation brings some evidence from past and current research to support this assertion.},

The results of this research provide a feasible theory and methodology for integrated applications of BIM. Furthermore, this study proposes a new approach for conflict and safety analysis during construction through the integration of construction simulation, 4D construction management, and safety analysis.

abstract = {Buildings account for 40{\%} of US primary energy consump- tion and 72{\%} of electricity. Of this total, 50{\%} of the energy consumed in buildings is used for Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Current HVAC systems only condition based on static schedules; rooms are condi- tioned regardless of occupancy. By conditioning rooms only when necessary, greater efficiency can be achieved. This paper describes POEM, a complete closed-loop system for optimally controlling HVAC systems in buildings based on actual occupancy levels. POEM is comprised of multiple parts. A wireless network of cameras called OPTNet is de- veloped that functions as an optical turnstile to measure area/zone occupancies. Another wireless sensor network of passive infrared (PIR) sensors called BONet functions along- side OPTNet. This sensed occupancy data from both sys- tems are then fused with an occupancy prediction model us- ing a particle filter in order to determine the most accurate current occupancy in each zone in the building. Finally, the information from occupancy prediction models and current occupancy is combined in order to find the optimal condi- tioning strategy required to reach target temperatures and minimize ventilation requirements. Based on live tests of the system, we estimate 30.0{\%} energy saving can be achieved while still maintaining thermal comfort.},

abstract = {When deploying an indoor 3D WSN, it is important to be able to determine positions of the sensor nodes that achieve the full-coverage of the target space and the connectivity between the sensor nodes with the minimum deployment cost. The sensor node deployment problem for 3D coverage and connectivity is NP-hard even without obstacles in the target field. Furthermore, no study has systematically examined the optimal 3D WSN deployment considering both obstacles and deployment cost. We have developed a heuristic algorithm for computing a near optimal solution that minimizes the cost for achieving the full coverage and node connectivity in a 3D target space with obstacles. We have implemented the algorithm in the smartspace simulator UbiREAL so that the designers can interactively determine the near-optimal sensor node positions thorough visualization of the achievable coverage and the sensor positions on a 3D virtual space. In this demonstration, we show, for different configurations of the target space and WSN parameters, how the tool computes the sensor positions and visualizes the results such as achievable covered area, sensor positions, and the total cost.},

abstract = {With the prevalence of localization techniques in smartphones, location-based applications on mobiles have become increasingly popular. However, only minorities of applications can be triggered automatically by the predefined locations of interest without any human interaction. One reason is that the inevitable operation of location detection by GPS is power-intensive. While existing work has focused on energy efficiency in continuous location tracking, energy-efficient location detection for matching predefined location of interest remains to be further explored. This paper proposes a unified framework that supports energy-efficient location detection for automatic location-triggered applications. Our framework triggers desired events only when the user is approaching the predefined locations of interest. Besides the efforts we make to reduce the number of GPS updates by cooperating with other types of on-device sensors, the framework also aims to coordinate multiple location-triggered applications to further reduce energy consumption on location updates. We implemented our framework as a middleware in the Android operating system and conducted extensive real experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework can reduce the number of GPS requests and low the energy consumption of the smartphones significantly.},

abstract = {Heading information becomes widely used in ubiquitous computing applications for mobile devices. Digital mag- netometers, also known as geomagnetic field sensors, pro- vide absolute device headings relative to the earth's magnetic north. However, magnetometer readings are prone to sig- nificant errors in indoor environments due to the existence of magnetic interferences, such as from printers, walls, or metallic shelves. These errors adversely affect the perfor- mance and quality of user experience of the applications re- quiring device headings. In this paper, we propose Headio, a novel approach to provide reliable device headings in in- door environments. Headio achieves this by aggregating ceil- ing images of an indoor environment, and by using computer vision-based pattern detection techniques to provide direc- tional references. To achieve zero-configured and energy- efficient heading sensing, Headio also utilizes multimodal sensing techniques to dynamically schedule sensing tasks. To fully evaluate the system, we implemented Headio on both Android and iOS mobile platforms, and performed compre- hensive experiments in both small-scale controlled and large- scale public indoor environments. Evaluation results show that Headio constantly provides accurate heading detection performance in diverse situations, achieving better than 1 average heading accuracy, up to 33X improvement over ex- isting techniques.},

Several techniques have been proposed for tracking occupants in a home environment. However, the current techniques do not provide a seamless in-home locating system owing to the occupants' device- free movement and the lack of cost-effective infrastructure for home location tracking. In this paper, we propose a home occupant tracking system that uses a smartphone and an off-the-shelf smartwatch without additional infrastructure. In our system, activity fingerprints are automatically generated from the microphone and the inertial sensors of the smartwatch, and location information is periodically obtained from the smartphone. We designed a hidden Markov model using the relationship between home activities and the room's location. Extensive experiments showed that our system tracks the location of users with 87{\%} accuracy, even when there is no manual training for activities. Author},

abstract = {Radio network design (RND) is a fundamental problem in cellular networks for telecommunications. In these networks, the terrain must be covered by a set of base stations (or antennae), each of which defines a covered area called cell. The problem may be reduced to figure out the optimal placement of antennae out of a list of candidate sites trying to satisfy two objectives: to maximize the area covered by the radio signal and to reduce the number of used antennae. Consequently, RND is a bi-objective optimization problem. Previous works have solved the problem by using single-objective techniques which combine the values of both objectives. The used techniques have allowed to find optimal solutions according to the defined objective, thus yielding a unique solution instead of the set of Pareto optimal solutions. In this paper, we solve the RND problem using a multi-objective version of the algorithm CHC, which is the metaheuristic having reported the best results when solving the single-objective formulation of RND. This new algorithm, called MOCHC, is compared against a binary-coded NSGA-II algorithm and also against the provided results in the literature. Our experiments indicate that MOCHC outperfoms NSGA-II and, more importantly, it is more efficient finding the optimal solutions than single-objectives techniques.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to placing access points (APs) in wireless local area networks (WLAN). Unlike the traditional methods focusing on coverage maximization, we investigate how to place APs from the perspective of an indoor location system. We present a framework for linking the placement of APs and the positioning performance. Our algorithm, namely maximizing SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), aims at choosing a proper set of APs' locations so that the signal is maximized and the noise is minimized simultaneously. The proposed algorithm regards the location discriminant information as the signal and the degree of unstable measurements as the noise. Such numerical values provide a good theoretical formulation to measure the influence of the AP deployment. In our location system, we utilize such SNR ratio to deploy APs so as to reduce the positioning errors. Our location system is developed in a real-world WLAN environment, where the realistic measurements were collected. The experimental results show that the positioning accuracy is improved based on our deployment approach in different scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper firstly presents the benefits and critical challenges on the use of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for crowd data collection and monitoring. The major challenges include antenna characteristics, environment's complexity and scanning features. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are compared in this paper in terms of architecture, discovery time, popularity of use and signal strength. Type of antennas used and the environment's complexity such as trees for outdoor and partitions for indoor spaces highly affect the scanning range. The aforementioned challenges are empirically evaluated by “real” experiments using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Scanners. The issues related to the antenna characteristics are also highlighted by experimenting with different antenna types. Novel scanning approaches including Overlapped Zones and Single Point Multi-Range detection methods will be then presented and verified by real-world tests. These novel techniques will be applied for location identification of the MAC IDs captured that can extract more information about people movement dynamics.},

abstract = {Predicting the location of a user in indoor settings in a practical and energy-efficient manner is (still) a very non-trivial task. The latest challenge in indoor localization is not to design specialized sensors but to design and implement practical data fusion methods using the already available technologies. Current state-of-the-art indoor localization techniques utilize Wi-Fi and a variety of sensors inside smart phones to predict user location. Some also require site-specific input such as indoor floor plans or the location of Wi-Fi access points. In this paper, we propose to use physical (PHY) layer information from 4G cellular network signals such as Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) to logically predict user location. Since the cellular signals are received by the smart phones at no additional cost, our methodology is very energy-efficient. We implement a prototype system in Android and evaluated it over 60 indoor locations. The prediction accuracy ranged up to 91{\%} with an average localization error of less than 2.3m for any combination of 4G PHY layer information. The results show promise for improvements in current indoor localization systems using cellular signals.},

abstract = {Indoor localization is of great importance to a wide range of applications in the era of mobile computing. Current main- stream solutions rely on Received Signal Strength (RSS) of wireless signals as fingerprints to distinguish and infer loca- tions. However, those methods suffer from fingerprint am- biguity that roots in multipath fading and temporal dynam- ics of wireless signals. Though pioneer efforts have resorted to motion-assisted or peer-assisted localization, they neither work in real time nor work without the help of peer users, which introduces extra costs and constraints, and thus de- grades their practicality. To get over these limitations, we propose Argus, an image-assisted localization system for mo- bile devices. The basic idea of Argus is to extract geometric constraints from crowdsourced photos, and to reduce finger- print ambiguity by mapping the constraints jointly against the fingerprint space. We devise techniques for photo selection, geometric constraint extraction, joint location estimation, and build a prototype that runs on commodity phones. Extensive experiments show that Argus triples the localization accuracy of classic RSS-based method, in time no longer than normal WiFi scanning, with negligible energy consumption. Author},

We believe indoor positioning is an impor- tant primitive that can enable many ubiquitous computing applications. To tackle the challenges of drifting in estima- tion, sensitivity to phone position, as well as variability in user walking profiles, we have developed algorithms for re- liable detection of steps and heading directions, and accurate estimation and personalization of step length. We've built an end-to-end localization system integrating these modules and an indoor floor map, without the need for infrastruc- ture assistance. We demonstrated for the first time a meter- level indoor positioning system that is infrastructure free, phone position independent, user adaptive, and easy to de- ploy. We have conducted extensive experiments on users with smartphone devices, with over 50 subjectswalking over an aggregate distance of over 40 kilometers. Evaluation re- sults showed our system can achieve a mean accuracy of 1.5m for the in-hand case and 2m for the in-pocket case in a 31m×15m testing area.},
