  This paper firstly presents the benefits and critical challenges on the use
  of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for crowd data collection and monitoring. The major
  challenges include antenna characteristics, environment's complexity and
  scanning features. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are compared in this paper in terms of
  architecture, discovery time, popularity of use and signal strength. Type of
  antennas used and the environment's complexity such as trees for outdoor and
  partitions for indoor spaces highly affect the scanning range. The
  aforementioned challenges are empirically evaluated by “real” experiments
  using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Scanners. The issues related to the antenna
  characteristics are also highlighted by experimenting with different antenna
  types. Novel scanning approaches including Overlapped Zones and Single Point
  Multi-Range detection methods will be then presented and verified by
  real-world tests. These novel techniques will be applied for location
  identification of the MAC IDs captured that can extract more information
  about people movement dynamics.%

  With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as
  smartphones, sensors, cameras, and RFIDs, it is possible to collect massive
  amount of data for localization and tracking of people within commercial
  buildings. Enabled by such occupancy monitoring capabilities, there are
  extensive opportunities for improving the energy consumption of buildings via
  smart HVAC control. In this respect, the major challenges we envision are 1)
  to achieve occupancy monitoring in a minimally intrusive way, e.g., using the
  existing infrastructure in the buildings and not requiring installation of
  any apps in the users??? smart devices, and 2) to develop effective data
  fusion techniques for improving occupancy monitoring accuracy using a
  multitude of sources. This paper surveys the existing works on occupancy
  monitoring and multi-modal data fusion techniques for smart commercial
  buildings. The goal is to lay down a framework for future research to exploit
  the spatio-temporal data obtained from one or more of various IoT devices
  such as temperature sensors, surveillance cameras, and RFID tags that may be
  already in use in the buildings. A comparative analysis of existing
  approaches and future predictions for research challenges are also provided.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The goal of the paper is to provide an overview of the following classes of
  models:. Gradual cover models: These models seek to relax the "all or
  nothing" assumption by replacing it with a general coverage function which
  represents the proportion of demand covered at a certain distance from the
  facility. The cooperative cover model: This recently developed generalization
  is designed to replace the "individual coverage" assumption with a mechanism
  where all facilities contribute to the coverage of each demand point. This is
  accomplished by viewing coverage as the transmission of a "signal" by the
  facilities. The signal transmitted by each facility dissipates with distance.
  However, the signal received by each demand point is the aggregation of the
  transmissions from all the facilities. If the signal strength at the demand
  point exceeds a certain threshold, the point is covered, otherwise it is not.
  Variable radius model: This model is primarily designed to relax the "fixed
  coverage radius" assumption, making the coverage radius an endogenously
  determined function of the facility cost. Thus, instead of having to locate a
  certain pre-determined number of facilities, the decision-maker has a certain
  budget that can be used to construct facilities of different types, with the
  more expensive facilities having larger coverage radius. ?? 2009 Elsevier

  In this paper we propose a covering problem where the covering radius of a
  facility is controlled by the decision-maker; the cost of achieving a certain
  covering distance is assumed to be a monotonically increasing function of the
  distance (i.e., it costs more to establish a facility with a greater covering
  radius). The problem is to cover all demand points at a minimum cost by
  finding optimal number, locations and coverage radii for the facilities.
  Both, the planar and discrete versions of the model are considered. Heuristic
  approaches are suggested for solving large problems in the plane. These
  methods were tested on a set of planar problems. Mathematical programming
  formulations are proposed for the discrete problem, and a solution approach
  is suggested and tested. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.%

  In recent years, there has been an explosion of social and collaborative
  applications that leverage location to provide users novel and engaging
  experiences. Current location technologies work well outdoors but fare poorly
  indoors. In this paper we present LoCo, a new framework that can provide
  highly accurate room-level location using a supervised classification scheme.
  We provide experiments that show this technique is orders of magnitude more
  efficient than current state-of-the-art Wi-Fi localization techniques. Low
  classification overhead and computational footprint make classification
  practical and efficient even on mobile devices. Our framework has also been
  designed to be easily deployed and leveraged by developers to help create a
  new wave of location-driven applications and services.%

  Building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are
  considered to be the main target for energy reduction due to their
  significant contribution to commercial buildings' energy consumption. Knowing
  a building's occupancy plays a crucial role in implementing demand-response
  HVAC. In this paper we propose a new solution based on the iBeacon
  technology. This solution is different from the previous ones because it
  leverages on the Bluetooth Low Energy standard, which provides lower power
  consumption. Moreover, the iBeacon protocol can be used both on iOs systems
  and Android ones, making this new approach portable. Differently from our
  previous work based on iOS devices, in this paper we focus on an Android
  based solution with the aim of increasing the accuracy of the location and
  the energy efficiency of the entire system. We increased the accuracy by
  10{\%} and the energy efficiency by 15{\%}.%

  The comprehensive introduction to the art and science of locating facilities
  to make your organization more efficient, effective, and profitable. For the
  professional siting facilities, the task of translating organizational goals
  and objectives into concrete facilities requires a working familiarity with
  the theoretical and practical fundamentals of facility location planning and
  modeling. The first hands-on guide to using and developing facility location
  models, Network and Discrete Location offers a practiceoriented introduction
  to model-building methods and solution algorithms, complete with software to
  solve classical problems of realistic size and end-of-chapter exercises to
  enhance the reader's understanding. The text introduces the reader to the key
  classical location problems (covering, center, median, and fixed charge)
  which form the nucleus of facility location modeling. It also discusses
  real-life extensions of the basic models used in locating: production and
  distribution facilities, interacting services and facilities, and undesirable
  facilities. The book outlines a host of methodological tools for solving
  location models and provides insights into when each approach is useful and
  what information it provides. Designed to give readers a working familiarity
  with the basic facility location model types as well as an intuitive
  knowledge of the uses and limits of modeling techniques, Network and Discrete
  Location brings students and professionals alike swiftly from basic theory to
  technical fluency.%

  The Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Act specifies the fraction of all demands
  for service that must be reached in a given amount of time for urban and
  rural areas. The conditions have traditionally been interpreted to apply to
  the case in which all EMS vehicles are available to respond to demands. A
  model that considers the probability of a vehicle being busy is formulated
  and model properties are briefly discussed. The model is then applied to two
  problems: a 55-node test case and a 33-node census tract representation of
  Austin, Texas. The implications of the new model for EMS system design are
  discussed as are the limitations of the modeling approach.%

  Two problems are considered in this article. Both problems seek the location
  of p facilities. The first problem is the p median where the total distance
  traveled by customers is minimized. The second problem focuses on equalizing
  demand across facilities by minimizing the variance of total demand attracted
  to each facility. These models are unique in that the gravity rule is used
  for the allocation of demand among facilities rather than assuming that each
  customer selects the closest facility. In addition, we also consider a
  multiobjective approach, which combines the two objectives. We propose
  heuristic solution procedures for the problem in the plane. Extensive

  Heating, cooling and ventilation accounts for 35{\%} energy usage in the
  United States. Currently, most modern buildings still condition rooms
  assuming maximum occupancy rather than actual usage. As a result, rooms are
  often over-conditioned needlessly. Thus, in order to achieve efficient
  conditioning, we require knowledge of occupancy. This paper shows how real
  time occupancy data from a wireless sensor network can be used to create
  occupancy models which in turn can be integrated into building conditioning
  system for usage based demand control conditioning strategies. Using
  strategies based on sensor network occupancy model predictions, we show that
  it is possible to achieve 42{\%} annual energy savings while still
  maintaining American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning

  Buildings account for 40{\%} of US primary energy consump- tion and 72{\%} of
  electricity. Of this total, 50{\%} of the energy consumed in buildings is
  used for Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Current
  HVAC systems only condition based on static schedules; rooms are condi-
  tioned regardless of occupancy. By conditioning rooms only when necessary,
  greater efficiency can be achieved. This paper describes POEM, a complete
  closed-loop system for optimally controlling HVAC systems in buildings based
  on actual occupancy levels. POEM is comprised of multiple parts. A wireless
  network of cameras called OPTNet is de- veloped that functions as an optical
  turnstile to measure area/zone occupancies. Another wireless sensor network
  of passive infrared (PIR) sensors called BONet functions along- side OPTNet.
  This sensed occupancy data from both sys- tems are then fused with an
  occupancy prediction model us- ing a particle filter in order to determine
  the most accurate current occupancy in each zone in the building. Finally,
  the information from occupancy prediction models and current occupancy is
  combined in order to find the optimal condi- tioning strategy required to
  reach target temperatures and minimize ventilation requirements. Based on
  live tests of the system, we estimate 30.0{\%} energy saving can be achieved
  while still maintaining thermal comfort.%

  This paper presents a novel approach to placing access points (APs) in
  wireless local area networks (WLAN). Unlike the traditional methods focusing
  on coverage maximization, we investigate how to place APs from the
  perspective of an indoor location system. We present a framework for linking
  the placement of APs and the positioning performance. Our algorithm, namely
  maximizing SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), aims at choosing a proper set of APs'
  locations so that the signal is maximized and the noise is minimized
  simultaneously. The proposed algorithm regards the location discriminant
  information as the signal and the degree of unstable measurements as the
  noise. Such numerical values provide a good theoretical formulation to
  measure the influence of the AP deployment. In our location system, we
  utilize such SNR ratio to deploy APs so as to reduce the positioning errors.
  Our location system is developed in a real-world WLAN environment, where the
  realistic measurements were collected. The experimental results show that the
  positioning accuracy is improved based on our deployment approach in
  different scenarios.%

  We present algorithms for estimating the location of stationary and mobile
  users based on heterogeneous indoor RF technologies. We propose two location
  algorithms, selective fusion location estimation (SELFLOC) and region of
  confidence (RoC), which can be used in conjunction with classical location
  algorithms such as triangulation, or with third-party commercial location
  estimation systems. The SELFLOC algorithm infers the user location by
  selectively fusing location information from multiple wireless technologies
  and/or multiple classical location algorithms in a theoretically optimal
  manner. The RoC algorithm attempts to overcome the problem of aliasing in the
  signal domain, where different physical locations have similar RF
  characteristics, which is particularly acute when users are mobile. We have
  empirically validated the proposed algorithms using wireless LAN and
  Bluetooth technology. Our experimental results show that applying SELFLOC for
  stationary users when using multiple wireless technologies and multiple
  classical location algorithms can improve location accuracy significantly,
  with mean distance errors as low as 1.6 m. For mobile users we find that
  using RoC can allow us to obtain mean errors as low as 3.7 m. Both algorithms
  can be used in conjunction with a commercial location estimation system and
  improve its accuracy further.%

  We propose a graph-based, low-complexity sensor fusion approach for
  ubiquitous pedestrian indoor positioning using mobile devices. We employ our
  fusion technique to combine relative motion information based on step
  detection with WiFi signal strength measurements. The method is based on the
  well-known particle filter methodology. In contrast to previous work, we
  provide a probabilistic model for location estimation that is formulated
  directly on a fully discretized, graph-based representation of the indoor
  environment. We generate this graph by adaptive quantization of the indoor
  space, removing irrelevant degrees of freedom from the estimation problem. We
  evaluate the proposed method in two realistic indoor environments using real
  data collected from smartphones. In total, our dataset spans about 20
  kilometers in distance walked and includes 13 users and four different mobile
  device types. Our results demonstrate that the filter requires an order of
  magnitude less particles than state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining
  an accuracy of a few meters. The proposed low-complexity solution not only
  enables indoor positioning on less powerful mobile devices, but also saves
  much-needed resources for location-based end-user applications which run on
  top of a localization service.%

  People spend approximately 70{\%} of their time indoors. Understanding the
  indoor environments is therefore important for a wide range of emerging
  mobile per- sonal and social applications. Knowledge of indoor floorplans is
  often required by these applications. How- ever, indoor floorplans are either
  unavailable or obtain- ing them requires slow, tedious, and error-prone man-
  ual labor.$\backslash$nThis paper describes an automatic indoor floorplan
  construction system. Leveraging Wi-Fi fingerprints and user motion
  information, this system automatically constructs floorplan via three key
  steps: (1) room adja- cency graph construction to determine which rooms are
  adjacent; (2) hallway layout learning to estimate room sizes and order rooms
  along each hallway, and (3) force directed dilation to adjust room sizes and
  optimize the overall floorplan accuracy. Deployment study in three buildings
  with 189 rooms demonstrates high floorplan accuracy. The system has been
  implemented as a mo- bile middleware, which allows emerging mobile appli-
  cations to generate, leverage, and share indoor floor- plans.%

  When deploying an indoor 3D WSN, it is important to be able to determine
  positions of the sensor nodes that achieve the full-coverage of the target
  space and the connectivity between the sensor nodes with the minimum
  deployment cost. The sensor node deployment problem for 3D coverage and
  connectivity is NP-hard even without obstacles in the target field.
  Furthermore, no study has systematically examined the optimal 3D WSN
  deployment considering both obstacles and deployment cost. We have developed
  a heuristic algorithm for computing a near optimal solution that minimizes
  the cost for achieving the full coverage and node connectivity in a 3D target
  space with obstacles. We have implemented the algorithm in the smartspace
  simulator UbiREAL so that the designers can interactively determine the
  near-optimal sensor node positions thorough visualization of the achievable
  coverage and the sensor positions on a 3D virtual space. In this
  demonstration, we show, for different configurations of the target space and
  WSN parameters, how the tool computes the sensor positions and visualizes the
  results such as achievable covered area, sensor positions, and the total
  cost.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Many smart home applications, such as monitoring for the elderly and home
  automation, require location information for individual occupants. Several
  techniques have been proposed for tracking occupants in a home environment.
  However, the current techniques do not provide a seamless in-home locating
  system owing to the occupants' device- free movement and the lack of
  cost-effective infrastructure for home location tracking. In this paper, we
  propose a home occupant tracking system that uses a smartphone and an
  off-the-shelf smartwatch without additional infrastructure. In our system,
  activity fingerprints are automatically generated from the microphone and the
  inertial sensors of the smartwatch, and location information is periodically
  obtained from the smartphone. We designed a hidden Markov model using the
  relationship between home activities and the room's location. Extensive
  experiments showed that our system tracks the location of users with 87{\%}
  accuracy, even when there is no manual training for activities. Author%

  \field{abstract}{%
  This paper addresses reliable and accurate indoor localiza- tion using
  inertial sensors commonly found on commodity smartphones. We believe indoor
  positioning is an impor- tant primitive that can enable many ubiquitous
  computing applications. To tackle the challenges of drifting in estima- tion,
  sensitivity to phone position, as well as variability in user walking
  profiles, we have developed algorithms for re- liable detection of steps and
  heading directions, and accurate estimation and personalization of step
  length. We've built an end-to-end localization system integrating these
  modules and an indoor floor map, without the need for infrastruc- ture
  assistance. We demonstrated for the first time a meter- level indoor
  positioning system that is infrastructure free, phone position independent,
  user adaptive, and easy to de- ploy. We have conducted extensive experiments
  on users with smartphone devices, with over 50 subjectswalking over an
  aggregate distance of over 40 kilometers. Evaluation re- sults showed our
  system can achieve a mean accuracy of 1.5m for the in-hand case and 2m for
  the in-pocket case in a 31m×15m testing area.%

  With the prevalence of localization techniques in smartphones, location-based
  applications on mobiles have become increasingly popular. However, only
  minorities of applications can be triggered automatically by the predefined
  locations of interest without any human interaction. One reason is that the
  inevitable operation of location detection by GPS is power-intensive. While
  existing work has focused on energy efficiency in continuous location
  tracking, energy-efficient location detection for matching predefined
  location of interest remains to be further explored. This paper proposes a
  unified framework that supports energy-efficient location detection for
  automatic location-triggered applications. Our framework triggers desired
  events only when the user is approaching the predefined locations of
  interest. Besides the efforts we make to reduce the number of GPS updates by
  cooperating with other types of on-device sensors, the framework also aims to
  coordinate multiple location-triggered applications to further reduce energy
  consumption on location updates. We implemented our framework as a middleware
  in the Android operating system and conducted extensive real experiments. The
  experimental results demonstrate that our framework can reduce the number of
  GPS requests and low the energy consumption of the smartphones
  significantly.%

  The primary focus of Green IT has been on reducing energy use of the IT
  infrastructure itself. Additional significant energy savings can be achieved
  by using the IT infrastructure to enable energy savings in both the IT and
  non-IT infrastructure. Our premise is that energy can be saved by driving
  building operation on information gleaned from existing IT infrastructure
  already installed for non-energy purposes. We call our idea implicit
  occupancy sensing where existing IT infrastructure can be used to replace
  and/or supplement traditional dedicated sensors to determine building
  occupancy. Our implicit sensing methods are largely based on monitoring MAC
  and IP addresses in routers and wireless access points, and then correlating
  these addresses to the occupancy of a building, zone, and/or room. Occupancy
  data can be used to control lighting, HVAC, and other building functions to
  improve building functionality and reduce energy use. We experimentally
  evaluate the feasibility of this dual-use of IT infrastructure and assess the
  accuracy of implicit sensing. Our findings, based on data collected from two
  facilities, show that there is significant promise in implicit sensing using
  the existing IT infrastructure present in most modern non-residential
  buildings. 2011 IEEE.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Radio network design (RND) is a fundamental problem in cellular networks for
  telecommunications. In these networks, the terrain must be covered by a set
  of base stations (or antennae), each of which defines a covered area called
  cell. The problem may be reduced to figure out the optimal placement of
  antennae out of a list of candidate sites trying to satisfy two objectives:
  to maximize the area covered by the radio signal and to reduce the number of
  used antennae. Consequently, RND is a bi-objective optimization problem.
  Previous works have solved the problem by using single-objective techniques
  which combine the values of both objectives. The used techniques have allowed
  to find optimal solutions according to the defined objective, thus yielding a
  unique solution instead of the set of Pareto optimal solutions. In this
  paper, we solve the RND problem using a multi-objective version of the
  algorithm CHC, which is the metaheuristic having reported the best results
  when solving the single-objective formulation of RND. This new algorithm,
  called MOCHC, is compared against a binary-coded NSGA-II algorithm and also
  against the provided results in the literature. Our experiments indicate that
  MOCHC outperfoms NSGA-II and, more importantly, it is more efficient finding
  the optimal solutions than single-objectives techniques.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Predicting the location of a user in indoor settings in a practical and
  energy-efficient manner is (still) a very non-trivial task. The latest
  challenge in indoor localization is not to design specialized sensors but to
  design and implement practical data fusion methods using the already
  available technologies. Current state-of-the-art indoor localization
  techniques utilize Wi-Fi and a variety of sensors inside smart phones to
  predict user location. Some also require site-specific input such as indoor
  floor plans or the location of Wi-Fi access points. In this paper, we propose
  to use physical (PHY) layer information from 4G cellular network signals such
  as Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received
  Quality (RSRQ) to logically predict user location. Since the cellular signals
  are received by the smart phones at no additional cost, our methodology is
  very energy-efficient. We implement a prototype system in Android and
  evaluated it over 60 indoor locations. The prediction accuracy ranged up to
  91{\%} with an average localization error of less than 2.3m for any
  combination of 4G PHY layer information. The results show promise for
  improvements in current indoor localization systems using cellular signals.%

  Many occupant-oriented smarthome applications such as automated lighting,
  heating and cooling, and activity recognition need room location information
  of residents within a building. Surveillance based tracking systems used to
  track people in commercial buildings, are privacy invasive in homes. In this
  paper, we present the RF Doormat - a RF threshold system that can accurately
  track people's room locations by monitoring their movement through the
  doorways in the home. We also present a set of guidelines and a visualization
  to easily and rapidly setup the RF-Doormat system on any doorway. To evaluate
  our system, we perform 580 doorway crossings across 11 different doorways in
  a home. Results indicate that our system can detect doorway crossings made by
  people with an average accuracy of 98{\%}. To our knowledge, the RF Doormat
  is the first highly accurate room location tracking system that can be used
  for long time periods without the need for privacy invasive cameras.%

  Nowadays many systems with diverse technologies such as (GPS, Wi-Fi,
  Bluetooth, ZigBee, Ultra Wide Band, Ultrasounds, Infrared, etc) can be used
  for indoor location. One of the biggest challenges in indoor location systems
  is to determine the actual indoor position of the user using a smart device
  (Phone, PC, etc), due to their instability, cost, high-power consumption, low
  accuracy and low precision. To overcome those problems, we have designed,
  implemented and emulated an indoor location system based on RSSI (Receive
  Signal Strength indicator) of the Bluetooth low energy 4.0 (BLE). BLE 4.0
  technology is more advantageous in terms of long life expectancy, our
  approach is based on the deployment of equidistant nodes on the ceiling. The
  nodes are programmed to broadcast a periodic beacon at a time pace of 400ms
  and then to enter sleep mode. When a smart device enters within the
  broadcasting range, it locates the three access points (nodes) with the
  highest signal strength. This information can be calculated using one of the
  several localization algorithms (Dilatation). The proposed Dilatation
  algorithm can be easily implemented in the hardware due to its low
  complexity, the method can be successful even when using a few numbers of
  nodes. In average the system has about 0.5 {\~{}} 1 meters of error.%

  The main purpose of buildings is to provide a comfortable living environment
  for their occupants. This includes, among others, thermal, visual and
  acoustic comfort as well as indoor air quality. Except during the 1950's and
  1960's, it has always been considered important that an excess use of energy
  should be avoided in the construction and the management of a building,
  sometimes even at the cost of user comfort. Energy saving is, however, not
  the main purpose of the building. Indeed, if it were really so, the largest
  energy savings would be obtained by not erecting the building in the first
  place. Since the Rio conference, there have been more and more incentives to
  save energy and lower the impact of buildings on the environment. Therefore,
  there is no excuse for the building sector not to adopt a sustainable
  development policy. Some energy is required to control the indoor climate and
  indoor air quality. Therefore, it is often suspected that energy savings
  result in poorer indoor environment quality, or, on the contrary, that a high
  comfort level is the result of high technology and high energy consumption.
  This is not true. It is now generally admitted among building scientists that
  high quality energy services do not necessarily incur a high energy use, and
  that good environment quality can be obtained with a reasonable amount of
  energy and power, and with a low environmental impact. The presentation
  brings some evidence from past and current research to support this
  assertion.%

  Owing to numerous potential applications, wireless sensor networks have been
  the focus of a lot of research efforts lately. In this note we study one
  fundamental issue in such networks, namely the coverage problem, in which we
  would like to determine whether a region of interest is sufficiently covered
  by a given set of sensors. This problem is motivated by monitoring
  applications in sensor networks, as well as robustness concerns and protocol
  requirements. We show that the coverage problem and some of its variants can
  be treated in a unified manner using suitable generalizations of the Voronoi
  diagram. As a result, we are able to give algorithms that have better
  runtimes than those proposed in previous works (see, e.g., [5, 6]). Our
  approach also yields efficient algorithms for coverage problems where the

  Heading information becomes widely used in ubiquitous computing applications
  for mobile devices. Digital mag- netometers, also known as geomagnetic field
  sensors, pro- vide absolute device headings relative to the earth's magnetic
  north. However, magnetometer readings are prone to sig- nificant errors in
  indoor environments due to the existence of magnetic interferences, such as
  from printers, walls, or metallic shelves. These errors adversely affect the
  perfor- mance and quality of user experience of the applications re- quiring
  device headings. In this paper, we propose Headio, a novel approach to
  provide reliable device headings in in- door environments. Headio achieves
  this by aggregating ceil- ing images of an indoor environment, and by using
  computer vision-based pattern detection techniques to provide direc- tional
  references. To achieve zero-configured and energy- efficient heading sensing,
  Headio also utilizes multimodal sensing techniques to dynamically schedule
  sensing tasks. To fully evaluate the system, we implemented Headio on both
  Android and iOS mobile platforms, and performed compre- hensive experiments
  in both small-scale controlled and large- scale public indoor environments.
  Evaluation results show that Headio constantly provides accurate heading
  detection performance in diverse situations, achieving better than 1 average
  heading accuracy, up to 33X improvement over ex- isting techniques.%

  This paper presents a lightweight method for localizing and counting people
  in indoor spaces using motion and size criteria. A histogram designed to
  filter moving objects within a specified size range, can operate directly on
  frame difference output to localize human-sized moving entities in the field
  of view of each camera node. Our method targets a custom, ultra-low power
  imager architecture operating on address-event representation, aiming to
  implement the proposed algorithm on silicon. In this paper we describe the
  details of our design and experimentally determine suitable parameters for
  the proposed histogram. The resulting histogram and counting algorithm are
  implemented and tested on a set of iMote2 camera sensor nodes deployed in our

  Improving energy efficiency in buildings is a key objec-tive for sensor
  researchers and promises significant reduc-tions in energy usage across the
  world. The key technolog-ical driver for these gains are the novel sensor
  network de-ployments and the large amounts of data that they generate. The
  challenge however is making sense of this data, and us-ing it effectively to
  design smarter building control schemes. Several recent research efforts have
  sought to address the challenge of data access and building control. However,
  while these systems have made progress in specific areas, many unanswered
  questions still revolve around data man-agement and what exactly it means to
  develop building ap-plications. Critically, how would such a solution work in
  a real building setting and how can applications be written such that they
  can be re-used in other settings? To resolve these issues we have developed
  BuildingDepot 2.0, a build-ing management control platform that significantly
  updates on our first iteration of the system for data analysis and high level

  Indoor localization is of great importance to a wide range of applications in
  the era of mobile computing. Current main- stream solutions rely on Received
  Signal Strength (RSS) of wireless signals as fingerprints to distinguish and
  infer loca- tions. However, those methods suffer from fingerprint am- biguity
  that roots in multipath fading and temporal dynam- ics of wireless signals.
  Though pioneer efforts have resorted to motion-assisted or peer-assisted
  localization, they neither work in real time nor work without the help of
  peer users, which introduces extra costs and constraints, and thus de- grades
  their practicality. To get over these limitations, we propose Argus, an
  image-assisted localization system for mo- bile devices. The basic idea of
  Argus is to extract geometric constraints from crowdsourced photos, and to
  reduce finger- print ambiguity by mapping the constraints jointly against the
  fingerprint space. We devise techniques for photo selection, geometric
  constraint extraction, joint location estimation, and build a prototype that
  runs on commodity phones. Extensive experiments show that Argus triples the
  localization accuracy of classic RSS-based method, in time no longer than
  normal WiFi scanning, with negligible energy consumption. Author%

  With the development of information technology, both Building Information
  Modelling (BIM) technology and lean construction concept became more and more
  widely applied in the engineering field in our country, meanwhile resulting
  in their prominent synergies with each other. BIM technology and lean
  construction concept are designed aimed at reducing wastes, saving costs,
  increasing productivity, and creating maximum value at the same time.
  Therefore, it will be more effective on value creation for their
  collaboration compared to their separate utilization from engineer
  perspective. This paper reports the combined technique between BIM technology
  and lean construction concept for its application in the cost management of
  engineering project of the building throughout the life-cycle among BIM mode,
  the lean cost analysis and control research. This combined technology is
  shown to be not only the main characteristic of construction enterprises but
  also the reference on improvement of production efficiency as well as
  competitiveness.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Strengthening construction safety analysis and management is of great social
  and economic significance. For a long time, however, there has been a lack of
  effective management tools in this important area that involves people's
  lives and property. Based on new developments in the Building Information
  Model (BIM), four-dimensional (4D) technology, time-dependent structural
  analysis, collision detection, and so on, a 4D structural information model
  is presented and established according to the overall solution of analysis
  and management for conflict and safety problems during construction. Based on
  this sub-BIM, the integration of dynamic safety analysis of time-dependent
  structures, conflict analysis and management of schedule/resource/cost, and
  dynamic collision detection of site facilities is studied, and theories and
  key technologies are discussed in detail. The results of this research
  provide a feasible theory and methodology for integrated applications of BIM.
  Furthermore, this study proposes a new approach for conflict and safety
  analysis during construction through the integration of construction
  simulation, 4D construction management, and safety analysis. The approach
  lays a foundation for the popularization of complicated theories and
  methodologies, and has theoretical significance and application prospects in
  meeting the needs of improving the safety level during construction. ?? 2010

  \field{abstract}{%
  Wireless indoor positioning systems have become very popular and attractive
  in recent years. These systems have been successfully used in many fields
  such as asset tracking and inventory management, and location fingerprinting
  schemes are the most promising technique because of technical restrictions.
  However, how to optimize the location of access points to improve the
  positioning accuracy is still a challenging and difficult problem because of
  the complexity of indoor radio propagation environments. In this paper, we
  firstly discussed the indoor radio propagation model and proposed a novel
  optimization model for access points location optimization in which the
  Euclidean distance of received signal strength array among all the sampling
  points should be maximize in order to increase the differentia and diversity
  of the signal strength array, and thus improve the positioning accuracy of
  location fingerprinting schemes. Then we presented the Differential Evolution
  algorithm which was used to optimize the proposed problem, and the
  experimental testbed, experimental results and analysis were discussed.
  Experimental results show that the proposed model for access points location
  optimization can improve the positioning accuracy remarkably. Finally, we
  summarized the paper and gave possible future directions for research on
  access points location optimization for indoor environments. Keywords-%

  The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information
  about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for
  speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation
  on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as
  well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a
  result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and
  highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions
  of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that
  the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep
  posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length
  of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not
  significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue
  motility.%
